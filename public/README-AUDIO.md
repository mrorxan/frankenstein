# Audio Files for Frankenstein Landing Page

This project requires the following audio files to be placed in the public directory:

1. `thunder.mp3` - A thunder sound effect for the typewriter animation
2. `scream.mp3` - A subtle scream sound effect for the Enter Laboratory button
3. `storm-ambient.mp3` - Ambient storm noises (distant thunder, rain) for background atmosphere

You can find suitable royalty-free sound effects from websites like:
- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)

Place these files directly in the public folder to ensure they are properly loaded by the application.
